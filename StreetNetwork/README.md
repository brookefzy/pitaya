# Intro to graph of streets
## Backgrounds
The street network is one of the core assets in Urban analysis. A large amount of research relies on network analysis.
## Goal
1. Use OSMnx package to download street network for a neighborhood
2. Use OSMnx package to download POI
3. Understand the basic terms used in Graph theory
4. Understand centrality basics
5. We will demo one research projects using street network to understand social segregation at street level (presentation to add)
