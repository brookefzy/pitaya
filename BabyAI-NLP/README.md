# Simple Implementation of NLP models
## Background
* This is a simple exercise to understand the basics of some language models
* We use simple word frequency model to analyze the trend of machine learning in urban studies by analyzing the recent paper's abstract from Web of Science.

## Goal
1. Understand n-grams and word frequency
2. Understand word embeddings
3. Proper prompt engineering
