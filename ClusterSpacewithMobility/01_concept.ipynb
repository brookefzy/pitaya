    "# Fuzzy clustering\n",
    "Fuzzy logic principles can be used to cluster multidimensional data, assigning each point a membership in each cluster center from 0 to 100 percent.\n",
    "* Attribution to a cluster: In fuzzy clustering, each point has a probability of belonging to each cluster, rather than completely belonging to just one cluster as it is the case in the traditional k-means. In Fuzzy-C Means clustering, each point has a weighting associated with a particular cluster, so a point doesn’t sit “in a cluster” as much as has a weak or strong association to the cluster, which is determined by the inverse distance to the center of the cluster.\n",
    "* Speed: Fuzzy-C means will tend to run slower than K means, since it’s actually doing more work. Each point is evaluated with each cluster, and more operations are involved in each evaluation. K-Means just needs to do a distance calculation, whereas fuzzy c means needs to do a full inverse-distance weighting (See equation below).\n",
    "* Fuzzy c-means is a special case of K-means when the probability function used is simply 1 if the data point is closest to a centroid and 0 otherwise.\n",
