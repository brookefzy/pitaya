# Housing Price Predictor
## Background
Housing price prediction is one of the most famous task in ML/AL in the real-estate world. In this section, we will use housing price prediction to go over the basic ML models (linear and non-linear models).
## Goal
This chapter involves three sections. Students are expected to do:
### 1. Data exploration
* Use python data visualization package to conduct basic EDA (Exploratory data anlysis)
* Understand data type
* Understand data distribution
* Analyze and impute missing values

### 2. Linear models
* Understand the differences between Ordinary Least Square Linear Regressions, Lasso Regressions, Ridge Regressions
* Use cross-validation to find best alpha for a Lasso Regression
* Understand model evaluation metrics: R2, MSE, RMSE
* **Self-guide**: the student needs to finish the homework in `02b` for the first day.

### 3. Non-linear models
* Use common non-linear regression models (random forest, Gradient Boosting Regressor, XGBoost) to predict housing price
* Compare evaluation metrics to find the best models to use
* Learn to use permutation importance to analyze feature importance for individual feature
* Able to explain `overfitting`
* **Self-guide**: the student should use a different non-linear model and get the result for the test dataset provided by the exercise.
